# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning  
This project focuses on building a regression model to predict the sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. It uses the dataset provided by the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training using various regression techniques, and performance evaluation.  
  
## 📌 Project Overview  
- 🎯 Goal: Predict `SalePrice` based on 79 features describing residential homes  
- 📂 Dataset Source: [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)  
- 🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- 🤖 Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM  
  
## 🧾 Features  
- Data Preprocessing and Missing Value Handling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
